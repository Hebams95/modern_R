# Descriptive statistics and data manipulation

Now that we are familiar with some R objects and know how to import data, it is time to write some
code. In this chapter, we are going to compute descriptive statistics for a single dataset, but
also for a list of datasets. However, I will not give a list of functions to compute descriptive
statistics; if you need a specific function you can find easily in the *Help* pane in Rstudio or
using any modern internet search engine. What I will do is show you a workflow that allows you to
compute the statisics you need fast.
R has a lot of built-in functions for descriptive statistics; however, if you want to compute
statistics by, say, gender, some more complex manipulations are needed. At least this was true in
the past. Nowadays, thanks to the packages from the `tidyverse`, it is very easy and fast to
compute descriptive statistics by any stratifying variable(s). The packages we are going to use for
this are called `dplyr` and `tidyr`. `dplyr` contains a lot of functions that make manipulating
data and computing descriptive statistics very easy. To make things easier for now, we are going to
use example data included with `dplyr`. So no need to import an external dataset; this does not
change anything to the example that we are going to study here; the source of the data does not
matter for this. `tidyr` is very useful to reshape data and to do advanced cleaning of your data.
All these tidyverse functions are also called *verbs*. Before learning about these verbs, let's discuss
about pipes.

## Smoking is bad for you, but pipes are your friend

The title of this section might sound weird at first, but by the end of it, you'll get this
(terrible) pun.

You probably know the following painting by RenÃ© Magritte, *La trahison des images*:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/pas_une_pipe.png")
```

It turns out there's an R package from the `tidyverse` that is called `magrittr`. What does this
package do? It brings *pipes* to R. Pipes are a concept from the Unix operating system; if you're
using a GNU+Linux distribution or macOS, you're basically using a *modern* unix (that's an
oversimplification, but I'm an economist by training, and outrageously oversimplifying things is
what we do, deal with it).

The idea of pipes is to take the output of a command, and *feed* it as the input of another
command. The `magrittr` package brings pipes to R, by using the weird looking `%>%`. Try the
following:

```{r, include = FALSE}
library(magrittr)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(magrittr)
```

```{r}
16 %>% sqrt
```

Super weird right? But you probably understand what happened; `16` got *fed* as the first argument of
the function `sqrt()`. You can chain multiple functions:

```{r}
16 %>% sqrt %>% `+`(18)
```

The output of `16` (`16`) got fed to `sqrt()`, and the output of `sqrt(16)` (4) got fed to `+(18)`
(22). Without `%>%` you'd write the line just above like this:

```{r}
sqrt(16) + 18
```

It might not be very clear right now why this is useful, but the `%>%` is probably one of the
most useful infix operators, because when using packages from the `tidyverse`, you will
naturally want to chain a lot of functions together. Without the `%>%` it would become messy very fast.

`%>%` is not the only pipe operator in `magrittr`. There's `%T%`, `%<>%` and `%$%`. All have their
uses, but are basically shortcuts to some common tasks with `%>%` plus another function. Which
means that you can live without them, and because of this, I will only discuss them briefly once
we'll have learned about the other `tidyverse` packages.

## The `{tidyverse}`'s *enfant prodige*: `{dplyr}`

The best way to get started with the tidyverse packages is to get to know `{dplyr}`. `{dplyr}` prodives
a lot of very useful functions that makes it very easy to get discriptive statistics or add new columns
to your data.

### A first taste of data manipulation with `{dplyr}`

This section will walk you through a typical analysis using `{dplyr}` funcitons. Just go with it; I
will give more details in the next sections.

First, let's load `dplyr` and the included `starwars` dataset. Let's also take a look at the first 5
lines of the dataset:

```{r, cache=TRUE}
library(dplyr)

data(starwars)

head(starwars)
```

`data(starwars)` loads the example dataset called `starwars` that is included in the package `dplyr`.
As I said earlier, this is just an example; you could have loaded an external dataset, from a
`.csv` file for instance. This does not matter for what comes next.

R includes a lot of functions for descriptive statistics, such as `mean()`, `sd()`, `cov()`, and many
more. What `dplyr` brings to the table (among other niceties) is the possibility to apply these
functions to the dataset easily. For example, imagine you want the average height of everyone in
the dataset. Using the basic R functions, you could write this:

```{r, cache=TRUE}
mean(starwars$height)
```

`starwars$height` means that the user wants to access the column called `height` from the dataset
`starwars`. Remember that the `$` symbol is how you access elements of a named list. This is the
same for columns of datasets as you can see. This is then given as an argument to the function
`mean()`. But what if the user wants the average height by species? Before `dplyr`, a solution to
this simple problem would have required more than a single command. Now this is as easy as:

```{r, cache=TRUE}
starwars %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarise(mean(height))
```

The usefulness of the `%>%` (pipe operator) becomes apparent now. Without it, one would write
instead:

```{r, cache=TRUE}
summarise(group_by(starwars, species), mean(height))
```

as you can clearly see, it is much more difficult to read. Imagine now that I want the average height
by species, but only for males. Again, this is very easy using `%>%`:

```{r, cache=TRUE}
starwars %>%
  filter(gender == "male") %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarise(mean(height))
```

Again, the `%>%` makes the above lines of code very easy to read. Without it, one would need to write:

```{r, cache=TRUE}
summarise(group_by(filter(starwars, gender == "male"), species), mean(height))
```

I think you agree with me that this is not very readable. Once you're used to `%>%`, you won't go
back to not use it.

To be a bit more precise: make things clearer; `filter()`, `group_by()` and `summarise()` are
functions that are included in `dplyr`. `%>%` is actually a function from `magrittr`, but this
package gets loaded on the fly when you load `dplyr`, so you do not need to worry about it.
`mean()` is a function *native* to R.

The result of all these operations that use `dplyr` functions are actually other datasets, or
`tibbles`. This means that you can save them in variable, and then work with these as any other
datasets.

```{r, cache=TRUE}
mean_height = starwars %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarise(mean(height))

class(mean_height)

head(mean_height)
```

You could then write this data to disk using `rio::export()` for instance. If you need more than the
mean of the height, you can keep adding as many functions as needed:

```{r, cache=TRUE}
summary_table = starwars %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarise(ave_height = mean(height), var_height = var(height), n_obs = n())

print(summary_table)
```

I've added more functions, namely `var()`, to get the variance of height, and `n()`, which
is a function from `dplyr`, not base R, to get the number of observations. This is quite useful,
because we see that for a lot of species we only have one single individual! Let's focus on the
species for which we have more than 1 individual. Since we save all the previous operations (which
produce a `tibble`) in a variable, we can keep going from there:

```{r, cache=TRUE}
summary_table2 = summary_table %>%
  filter(n_obs > 1)

print(summary_table2)
```

There's a lot of `NA`s; this is because by default, `mean()` and `var()` return `NA` if even one
single observation is `NA`. This is good, because it forces you to look at the data
to see what is going on. If you would get a number, even if there were `NA`s you could very easily
miss these missing values. It is better for functions to fail early and often than the opposite.
`mean()` and `var()` have a `na.rm` option that the user can set to `TRUE` to get the result by
ignoring the `NA`s:

```{r, cache=TRUE}
starwars %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarise(ave_height = mean(height, na.rm = TRUE), var_height = var(height, na.rm = TRUE), n_obs = n()) %>%
  filter(n_obs > 1)
```

In the code above, I have combined the two previous steps to get the result I'm interested in. There's
a line in the final output that says `NA` for the species. Let's go back to the raw data and find
these lines:

```{r, cache=TRUE}
starwars %>%
  filter(is.na(species))
```

To test for `NA`, one uses the function `is.na()` not something like `species == "NA"` or anything
like that. `!is.na()` does the opposite:

```{r, cache=TRUE}
starwars %>%
  filter(!is.na(species))
```

The `!` function negates a predicate function (a predicate function is a function that returns
`TRUE` or `FALSE`). We can then rerun our analysis from before:

```{r, cache=TRUE}
starwars %>%
  filter(!is.na(species)) %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarise(ave_height = mean(height, na.rm = TRUE), var_height = var(height, na.rm = TRUE), n_obs = n()) %>%
  filter(n_obs > 1)
```

And why not compute the same table, but first add another stratifying variable?

```{r, cache=TRUE}
starwars %>%
  filter(!is.na(species)) %>%
  group_by(species, gender) %>%
  summarise(ave_height = mean(height, na.rm = TRUE), var_height = var(height, na.rm = TRUE), n_obs = n()) %>%
  filter(n_obs > 1)
```

Ok, that's it for a first taste. We have already discovered some very useful `{dplyr}` functions,
`filter()`, `group_by()` and summarise `summarise()`.

Now, we are going to learn more about these functions in more detail.

### Filter the rows of a dataset with `filter()`

We're going to use the `Gasoline` dataset from the `plm` package, so install that first:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("plm")
```

Then load the required data:

```{r}
data(Gasoline, package = "plm")
```

and load dplyr:

```{r}
library(dplyr)
```

This dataset gives the consumption of gasoline for 18 countries from 1960 to 1978. When
you load the data like this, it is a standard `data.frame`. `dplyr` functions can be used on
standard `data.frame` objects, but also on `tibble`s. `tibble`s are just like data frame,
but with a better print method (and other niceties). I'll discuss the `{tibble}` package later,
but for now, let's convert the data to a `tibble` and change its name:

```{r}
gasoline <- as_tibble(Gasoline)
```

`filter()` is pretty straightforward. What if you would like to subset the data to focus on the
year 1969? Simple:

```{r}
filter(gasoline, year == 1969)
```

Let's use `%>%`, since we're familiar with it now:

```{r}
gasoline %>% filter(year == 1969)
```

You can also filter more than just one year, by using the `%in%` operator:

```{r}
gasoline %>% filter(year %in% seq(1969, 1973))
```

or even non-consecutive years:

```{r}
gasoline %>% filter(year %in% c(1969, 1973, 1977))
```

`%in%` tests if an object is part of a set.

### Select columns with `select()`

While `filter()` allows you to keep or discard rows of data, `select()`
allows you to keep or discard entire columns. To keep columns:

```{r}
gasoline %>% select(country, year, lrpmg)
```

To discard them:

```{r}
gasoline %>% select(-country, -year, -lrpmg)
```

To rename them:

```{r}
gasoline %>% select(country, date = year, lrpmg)
```

There's also `rename()`:

```{r}
gasoline %>% rename(date = year)
```

`rename()` does not do any kind of selection, but just renames.

You can also use `select()` to re-order columns:

```{r}
gasoline %>% select(year, country, lrpmg, everything())
```

`everything()` is a helper function, and there's also `starts_with()`,
and `ends_with()`. For example, what if we are only interested
in columns whose name start with "l"?

```{r}
gasoline %>% select(starts_with("l"))
```

`ends_with()` works in a similar fashion. There is also `contains()`, but I will
discuss that one later.

Another verb, similar to `select()`, is `pull()`. Let's compare the two:

```{r}
gasoline %>% select(lrpmg)
```

```{r}
gasoline %>% pull(lrpmg)
```

`pull()`, unlike `select()`, does not return a `tibble`, but only the column you want.

### Group the observations of your dataset with `group_by()`

`group_by()` is a very useful verb; as the name implies, it allows you to create groups and then,
for example, compute descriptive statistics by groups. For example, let's group our data by
country:

```{r}
gasoline %>% group_by(country)
```

It looks like nothing much happened, but if you look at the second line of the output you can read
the following:

```{r}
## # Groups:   country [18]
```

this means that the data is grouped, and every computation you will do now will take these groups
into account. It is also possible to group by more than one variable:

```{r}
gasoline %>% group_by(country, year)
```

and so on. You can then also ungroup:

```{r}
gasoline %>% group_by(country, year) %>% ungroup()
```

Once your data is grouped, the operations that will follow will be executed inside each group.

### Get summary statistics with `summarise()`

Ok, now that we have learned the basic verbs, we can start to do more interesting stuff. For
example, one might want to compute the average gasoline consumption in each country, for
the whole period:

```{r}
gasoline %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarise(mean(lgaspcar))
```

`mean()` was given as an argument to `summarise()`, which is a `dplyr` verb. What we get is another
tibble, that contains the variable we used to group, as well as the average per country. We can
also rename this column:

```{r}
gasoline %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarise(mean_gaspcar = mean(lgaspcar))
```

and because the output is a `tibble`, we can continue to use `dplyr` verbs on it:

```{r}
gasoline %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarise(mean_gaspcar = mean(lgaspcar)) %>%
  filter(country == "FRANCE")
```

`summarise()` is a very useful verb. For example, we can compute several descriptive statistics at once:

```{r}
gasoline %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarise(mean_gaspcar = mean(lgaspcar),
            sd_gaspcar = sd(lgaspcar),
            max_gaspcar = max(lgaspcar),
            min_gaspcar = min(lgaspcar))
```

Because the output is a `tibble`, you can save it in a variable of course:

```{r}
desc_gasoline <- gasoline %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarise(mean_gaspcar = mean(lgaspcar),
            sd_gaspcar = sd(lgaspcar),
            max_gaspcar = max(lgaspcar),
            min_gaspcar = min(lgaspcar))
```

And then you can answer questions such as, *which country has the maximum average gasoline
consumption?*:

```{r}
desc_gasoline %>%
  filter(max(mean_gaspcar) == mean_gaspcar)
```

Turns out it's Turkey. What about the minimum consumption?

```{r}
desc_gasoline %>%
  filter(min(mean_gaspcar) == mean_gaspcar)
```

Because the output of `dplyr` verbs is a tibble, it is possible to continue working with it. This
is one shortcoming of using the base `summary()` function. The object returned by that function
is not very easy to manipulate.

### Adding columns with `mutate()` and `transmute()`

`mutate()` adds a column to the `tibble`, which can contain any transformation of any other
variable:

```{r}
gasoline %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  mutate(n())
```

Using `mutate()` I've added a column that counts how many times the country appears in the `tibble`,
using `n()`, another `dplyr` function. There's also `count()` and `tally()`, which we are going to
see further down. It is also possible to rename the column on the fly:

```{r}
gasoline %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  mutate(count = n())
```

It is possible to do any arbitrary operation:

```{r}
gasoline %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  mutate(spam = exp(lgaspcar + lincomep))
```

`transmute()` is the same as `mutate()`, but only returns the created variable:

````{r}
gasoline %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  transmute(spam = exp(lgaspcar + lincomep))
```

That was it for the basic `{dplyr}` verbs. Next, we're going to learn about `{tidyr}`.

## Reshaping data with `tidyr`

Another important package from the `tidyverse` that goes hand in hand with `dplyr` is `tidyr`. `tidyr`
is the package you need when it's time to reshape data. The basic functions from `tidyr`, `spread()`
and `gather()` make it possible to go from long to wide datasets respectively.

### `spread()` and `gather()`

Let's first create a fake dataset:

```{r, cache=TRUE}
library(tidyr)
```

```{r, cache=TRUE}
survey_data = tribble(
  ~id, ~variable, ~value,
  1, "var1", 1,
  1, "var2", 0.2,
  2, "var1", 1.4,
  2, "var2", 1.9,
  3, "var1", 0.1,
  3, "var2", 2.8,
  4, "var1", 1.7,
  4, "var2", 1.9
)

head(survey_data)
```

I used the `tribble()` function from the `{tibble}` package. I'll discuss this package later, for now,
let's focus on `{tidyr}.`

`survey_data` is a long dataset. We can reshape it to be wide using the `spread()` function:

```{r, cache=TRUE}
wide_data = survey_data %>%
  spread(variable, value)

head(wide_data)
```

This means that we spread the column called "variable", which will produce one column per category
of "variable". Then we fill in the rows with the data contained in the column "value".

To go from a wide dataset to a long one, we use `gather()`:

```{r, cache=TRUE}
long_data = wide_data %>%
  gather(variable, value, var1, var2)

print(long_data)
```

`long_data` and `survey_data` are the same datasets, but in a different order.

In the `wide_data` `tibble`, we had 3 columns: `id`, `var1` and `var2`. We want to stack 'var1' and
'var2' in a new column, that we choose to call "variable". This is the "key". For the value, we are
using the values contained in `var1` and `var2`. Sometimes using `spread()` or `gather()` requires
some trial and error. I advise you play around with the examples above to really grasp how these
powerful functions work.

### Put order in your columns with `separate()`, extract(), `unite()`, and in your rows with `separate_rows()`

### Go from implicit to explicit missing values with `complete()`, `expand()`, `crossing()` and `nesting()`

### `fill()` and `full_seq()`

```{r}
full_seq(c(as.Date("2018-08-01"), as.Date("2018-08-10")), 1)
```

That was it for a first introduction to `{tidyr}`. Other useful `{tidyr}` functions are coming, but for
now, let's learn about *scoped* verbs.

## Scoped `{tidyverse}` verbs

Scoped verbs are special versions of the verbs you are now familiar with.

### filter_()


`filter()` is not the only *filtering* verb there is. Suppose that we have a condition that we want
to use to filter out a lot of columns at once. For example, for every column that is of type
`numeric`, keep only the lines where the condition *value > -8* is satisfied. The next line does
that:

```{r}
gasoline %>% filter_if( ~all(is.numeric(.)), all_vars(. > -8))
```

It's a bit more complicated than before. `filter_if()` needs 3 arguments to work; the data, a
predicate function (a function that returns `TRUE`, or `FALSE`) which will select the columns we
want to work on, and then the condition. The condition can be applied to *all* the columns that
were selected by the predicate function (hence the `all_vars()`) or only to at least one (you'd use
`any_vars()` then). Try to change the condition, or the predicate function, to figure out how
`filter_if()` works. The dot is a placeholder that stands for whatever columns where selected.

`filter_at()` works differently; it allows the user to filter columns by position:

```{r}
gasoline %>% filter_at(vars(ends_with("p")), all_vars(. > -8))
```

`end_with()` is a helper function that we are going to use a lot (as well as `starts_with()` and
some others, you'll see..). So the above line means "for the columns whose name end with a 'p' only
keep the lines where, for all the selected columns, the values are strictly superior to `-8`".
Again, this is not very easy the first time you deal with that, so play around with it for a bit.

`filter_all()`, as the name implies, considers all variables for the filtering step.

`filter_if()` and `filter_at()` are very useful when you have very large datasets with a lot of
variables and you want to apply a filtering function only to a subset of them. `filter_all()` is
useful if, for example, you only want to keep the positive values for all the columns.

### select_()

The same can be achieved with `select_at()`:

```{r}
gasoline %>% select_at(vars(starts_with("l")))
```

`select_at()` can be quite useful if you know the position of the columns you're interested in:

```{r}
gasoline %>% select_at(vars(c(1,2,5)))
```

This also works with `filter_at()` by the way.

`select_if()` makes it easy to select columns that satisfy a criterium:

```{r}
gasoline %>% select_if(is.numeric)
```

You can even pass a further function to `select_if()` that will be applied to the selected columns:

```{r}
gasoline %>% select_if(is.numeric, toupper)
```

### group_by_()

### summarise_()


Just like for `filter()` and `select()`, `summarise()` comes with scoped versions:

```{r}
gasoline %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarise_at(vars(starts_with("l")), mean)
```

See how I managed to summarise every variable in one simple call to `summarise_at()`? Simply by
using `vars()` and specifying that I was interested in the ones that started with "l" and then I
specified the function I wanted. But what if I wanted to use more than one function to summarise
the data? Very easy:

```{r}
gasoline %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarise_at(vars(starts_with("l")), funs(mean, sd, max, min))
```

But maybe you're just interested in descriptive statistics for some variables, but not all those
that start with "l"? What if you want to use another pattern? Easy to do with the `contains()`
helper:

```{r}
gasoline %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarise_at(vars(dplyr::contains("car")), funs(mean, sd, max, min))
```

I used `dplyr::contains()` instead of simply `contains()` because there's also a
`purrr::contains()`. If you load `purrr` after `dplyr`, `contains()` will actually be
`purrr::contains()` and not `dplyr::contains()` which causes the above code to fail.

There's also `summarise_if()`:

```{r}
gasoline %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarise_if(is.double, funs(mean, sd, min, max))
```

This allows you to summarise every column that contain real numbers (if you use `is.numeric()`
instead, `year` will also be summarised, which is not really interesting).

To go faster, you can also use `summarise_all()`:

```{r}
gasoline %>%
  select(-year) %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarise_all(funs(mean, sd, min, max))
```

I removed the `year` variable because it's not a variable for which we want to have descriptive
statistics.

### mutate_()


`mutate()` and `transmute()` also come with scoped version:

```{r}
gasoline %>%
  mutate_if(is.double, exp)
```

```{r}
gasoline %>%
  mutate_at(vars(starts_with("l")), exp)
```

```{r}
gasoline %>%
  mutate_all(as.character)
```

## Other useful `{tidyverse}` functions


### `if_else()`, `case_when()` and `recode()`

The two helper functions I use the most are probably `if_else()` and `case_when`. These two
functions, combined with `mutate()` make it easy to create a new variable conditonally on the
values of other variables. For instance, we might want to have a dummy that equals `1` if a country
in the European Union (to simplify, say as of 2017) and `0` if not. First let's create a list of
countries that are in the EU:

```{r}
eu_countries <- c("austria", "belgium", "bulgaria", "croatia", "republic of cyprus",
                  "czech republic", "denmark", "estonia", "finland", "france", "germany",
                  "greece", "hungary", "ireland", "italy", "latvia", "lithuania", "luxembourg",
                  "malta", "netherla", "poland", "portugal", "romania", "slovakia", "slovenia",
                  "spain", "sweden", "u.k.")
```

I've had to change "netherlands" to "netherla" because that's how the country is called in the
data. Now let's create a dummy variable that equals `1` for EU countries, ind `0` for the others:

```{r}
gasoline %>%
  mutate(country = tolower(country)) %>%
  mutate(in_eu = if_else(country %in% eu_countries, 1, 0))
```

Instead of `1` and `0`, we can of course use strings (I add `filter(year == 1960)` at the end to
have a better view of what happened):

```{r}
gasoline %>%
  mutate(country = tolower(country)) %>%
  mutate(in_eu = if_else(country %in% eu_countries, "yes", "no")) %>%
  filter(year == 1960)
```

I think that `if_else()` is fairly straightforward, especially if you know `ifelse()` already. You
might be wondering what is the difference between these two. `if_else()` is stricter than
`ifelse()` and does not do type conversion. Compare the two next lines:

```{r}
ifelse(1 == 1, "0", 1)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
if_else(1 == 1, "0", 1)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
Error: `false` must be type string, not double
```

Type conversion, especially without a warning is very dangerous. `if_else()`'s behaviour which
consists in failing as soon as possble avoids a lot of pain and suffering, especially when
programming non-interactively.

`if_else()` also accepts an optional argument, that allows you to specify what should be returned
in case of `NA`:

```{r}
if_else(1 <= NA, 0, 1, 999)

# Or
if_else(1 <= NA, 0, 1, NA_real_)
```

`case_when()` can be seen as a generalization of `if_else()`. Whenever you want to use multiple
`if_else()`s, that's when you know you should use `case_when()` (I'm adding the filter at the end
for the same reason as before, to see the output better):

```{r}
gasoline %>%
  mutate(country = tolower(country)) %>%
  mutate(region = case_when(
           country %in% c("france", "italy", "turkey", "greece", "spain") ~ "mediterranean",
           country %in% c("germany", "austria", "switzerl", "belgium", "netherla") ~ "central europe",
           country %in% c("canada", "u.s.a.", "u.k.", "ireland") ~ "anglosphere",
           country %in% c("denmark", "norway", "sweden") ~ "nordic",
           country %in% c("japan") ~ "asia")) %>%
  filter(year == 1960)
```

If all you want is to recode values, you can use `recode()`. For example, the Netherlands is written as
"NETHERLA" in the which is quite ugly. Same for Switzerland:

```{r}
gasoline <- gasoline %>%
  mutate(country = tolower(country)) %>%
  mutate(country = recode(country, "netherla" = "netherlands", "switzerl" = "switzerland"))
```

I saved the data with these changes as they will become useful in the future. Let's take a look at
the data:

```{r}
gasoline %>%
  filter(country %in% c("netherlands", "switzerland"), year == 1960)
```

### `lead()` and `lag()`

`lead()` and `lag()` are especially useful in econometrics. When I was doing my masters, in 4 B.d.
(*Before dplyr*) lagging variables in panel data was quite tricky. Now, with `dplyr` it's really
very easy:

```{r}
gasoline %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  mutate(lag_lgaspcar = lag(lgaspcar)) %>%
  mutate(lead_lgaspcar = lead(lgaspcar)) %>%
  filter(year %in% seq(1960, 1963))
```

To lag every variable, remember that you can use `mutate_if()`:

```{r}
gasoline %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  mutate_if(is.double, lag) %>%
  filter(year %in% seq(1960, 1963))
```

you can replace `lag()` with `lead()`, but just keep in mind that the columns get transformed in
place.

### `ntile()`

The last helper function I will discuss is `ntile()`. There are some other, so do read `mutate()`'s
documentation with `help(mutate)`!

If you need quantiles, you need `ntile()`. Let's see how it works:

```{r}
gasoline %>%
  mutate(quintile = ntile(lgaspcar, 5)) %>%
  mutate(decile = ntile(lgaspcar, 10)) %>%
  select(country, year, lgaspcar, quintile, decile)
```

`quintile` and `decile` do not hold the values but the quantile the value lies in. If you want to
have a column that contains the median for instance, you can use good ol' `quantile()`:

```{r}
gasoline %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  mutate(median = quantile(lgaspcar, 0.5)) %>% # quantile(x, 0.5) is equivalent to median(x)
  filter(year == 1960) %>%
  select(country, year, median)
```

### `arrange()`

`arrange()` re-orders the whole `tibble` according to values of the supplied variable:

```{r}
gasoline %>%
  arrange(lgaspcar)
```

If you want to re-order the `tibble` in descending order of the variable:

```{r}
gasoline %>%
  arrange(desc(lgaspcar))
```

`arrange`'s documentation alerts the user that re-ording by group is only possible by explicitely
specifying an option:

```{r}
gasoline %>%
  filter(year %in% seq(1960, 1963)) %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  arrange(desc(lgaspcar), .by_group = TRUE)
```

### `tally()` and `count()`

`tally()` and `count()` count the number of observations in your data. I believe `count()` is the
more useful of the two, as it counts the number of observations within a group that you can provide:

```{r}
gasoline %>%
  count(country)
```
There's also `add_count()` which adds the column to the data:

```{r}
gasoline %>%
  add_count(country)
```

`add_count()` is a shortcut for the following code:

```{r}
gasoline %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  mutate(n = n())
```

where `n()` is a `dplyr` function that can only be used within `summarise()`, `mutate()` and
`filter()`.

## Joining `tibble`s with `full_join()`, `left_join()`, `right_join()` and all the others

I will end this section on `dplyr` with the very useful verbs: the `*_join()` verbs. Let's first
start by loading another dataset from the `plm` package. `SumHes` and let's convert it to `tibble`
and rename it:

```{r}
data(SumHes, package = "plm")

pwt <- SumHes %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  mutate(country = tolower(country))
```

Let's take a quick look at the data:

```{r}
glimpse(pwt)
```

We can merge both `gasoline` and `pwt` by country and year, as these two variables are common to
both datasets. There are more countries and years in the `pwt` dataset, so when merging both, and
depending on which function you use, you will either have `NA`'s for the variables where there is
no match, or rows that will be dropped. Let's start with `full_join`:

```{r}
gas_pwt_full <- gasoline %>%
  full_join(pwt, by = c("country", "year"))
```

Let's see which countries and years are included:

```{r}
gas_pwt_full %>%
  count(country, year)
```

As you see, every country and year was included, but what happened for, say, the U.S.S.R? This country
is in `pwt` but not in `gasoline` at all:

```{r}
gas_pwt_full %>%
  filter(country == "u.s.s.r.")
```

As you probably guessed, the variables from `gasoline` that are not included in `pwt` are filled with
`NA`s. One could remove all these lines and only keep countries for which these variables are not
`NA` everywhere with `filter()`, but there is a simpler solution:

```{r}
gas_pwt_inner <- gasoline %>%
  inner_join(pwt, by = c("country", "year"))
```
Let's use the `tabyl()` from the `janitor` packages which is a very nice alternative to the `table()`
function from base R:

```{r}
library(janitor)

gas_pwt_inner %>%
  tabyl(country)
```

Only countries with values in both datasets were returned. It's almost every country from `gasoline`,
apart from Germany (called "germany west" in `pwt` and "germany" in `gasoline`. I left it as is to
provide an example of a country not in `pwt`). Let's also look at the variables:

```{r}
glimpse(gas_pwt_inner)
```

The variables from both datasets are in the joined data.

Contrast this to `semi_join()`:


```{r}
gas_pwt_semi <- gasoline %>%
  semi_join(pwt, by = c("country", "year"))

glimpse(gas_pwt_semi)

gas_pwt_semi %>%
  tabyl(country)
```

Only columns of `gasoline` are returned, and only rows of `gasoline` that were matched with rows
from `pwt`. `semi_join()` is not a commutative operation:


```{r}
pwt_gas_semi <- pwt %>%
  semi_join(gasoline, by = c("country", "year"))

glimpse(pwt_gas_semi)

gas_pwt_semi %>%
  tabyl(country)
```

The rows are the same, but not the columns.


`left_join()` and `right_join()` return
all the rows from either the dataset that is on the "left" (the first argument of the fonction)
or on the "right" (the second argument of the function) but all columns from both datasets. So
depending on which countries you're interested in, you're going to use either one of these functions:

```{r}
gas_pwt_left <- gasoline %>%
  left_join(pwt, by = c("country", "year"))

gas_pwt_left %>%
  tabyl(country)
```

```{r}
gas_pwt_right <- gasoline %>%
  right_join(pwt, by = c("country", "year"))

gas_pwt_right %>%
  tabyl(country)
```

The last merge function is `anti_join()`:


```{r}
gas_pwt_anti <- gasoline %>%
  anti_join(pwt, by = c("country", "year"))

glimpse(gas_pwt_anti)

gas_pwt_anti %>%
  tabyl(country)
```

`gas_pwt_anti` has the columns the `gasoline` dataset as well as the only country from `gasoline`
that is not in `pwt`: "germany".

## Special packages for special kinds of data: `{forcats}`, `{lubridate}`, and `{stringr}`

### ðððð

Factor variables are very useful but not very easy to manipulate. `forcats` contains very useful functions
that make working on factor variables painless. I use mainly three functions in my work, `fct_recode()`,
`fct_relevel()` and `fct_relabel()`, so that's what I'll be showing.

Remember in chapter 3 when I very quickly explained what were `factor` variables? In this section,
we are going to work a little bit with these type of variable. `factor`s are very useful, and the
`forcats` package includes some handy functions to work with them. First, let's load the `forcats` package:

```{r}
library(forcats)
```

as an example, we are going to work with the `gss_cat` dataset that is included in `forcats`. Let's
load that:

```{r}
data(gss_cat)

head(gss_cat)
```

as you can see, `marital`, `race`, `rincome` and `partyid` are all factor variables. Let's take a closer
look at `marital`:

```{r}
str(gss_cat$marital)
```

and let's see `rincome`:

```{r}
str(gss_cat$rincome)
```

`factor` variables have different levels and the `forcats` package includes functions that allow
you to recode, collapse and do all sorts of things on these levels. For example , using
`forcats::fct_recode()` you can recode levels:

```{r}
gss_cat = gss_cat %>%
  mutate(marital = fct_recode(marital,
                              refuse = "No answer",
                              never_married = "Never married",
                              divorced = "Separated",
                              divorced = "Divorced",
                              widowed = "Widowed",
                              married = "Married"))

gss_cat %>%
  tabyl(marital)
```

Using `fct_recode()`, I was able to recode the levels and collapse `Separated` and `Divorced` to
a single category called `divorced`. As you can see, `refuse` and `widowed` are less than 10%, so
maybe you'd want to lump these categories together:

```{r}
gss_cat = gss_cat %>%
  mutate(marital = fct_lump(marital, prop = 0.10, other_level = "other"))

gss_cat %>%
  tabyl(marital)
```

I suggest you read `forcats`' help page and discover the other functions it contains.


###  Get your dates right with `{lubridate}`

### Manipulate strings with `{stringr}`

## List-columns

To learn about list-columns, let's first focus on a single character of the `starwars` dataset:

```{r, cache=TRUE}
data(starwars)
```

```{r, cache=TRUE}
starwars %>%
  filter(name == "Luke Skywalker") %>%
  glimpse()
```

We see that the columns `films`, `vehicles` and `starships` are all lists, and in the case of
`films`, it lists all the films where Luke Skywalker has appeared. What if you want to take a closer look at this list?

```{r, cache=TRUE}
starwars %>%
  filter(name == "Luke Skywalker") %>%
  pull(films)
```

`pull()` is a `dplyr` function that extract (pulls) the column you're interested in. It is quite
useful when you want to inspect a column.

Suppose we want to create a categorical variable which counts the number of movies in which the
characters have appeared. For this we need to compute the length of the list, or count the number
of elements this list has. Let's try with `length()` a base R function:

```{r, cache=TRUE}
starwars %>%
  filter(name == "Luke Skywalker") %>%
  pull(films) %>%
  length()
```

This might be surprising at first, because we know that Luke Skywalker has appeared in more than 1
movie... the problem here is that for each individual, `films` is a list, whose single element is
a vector of characters. This means that `length(films)` computes the length of the list, which is
one, and not the length of the vector contained in the list! How can we get the length of the
vector of characters contained in the list and for each character? For this we need to use
`dplyr::rowwise()` and remove the `filter()` function and use `mutate()` to add this column to the
dataset:


```{r, cache=TRUE}
starwars = starwars %>%
  rowwise() %>%
  mutate(n_films = length(films))
```

`dplyr::rowwise()` is useful when working with list-columns: columns that have lists as elements.

Let's take a look at the characters and the number of films they have appeared in:

```{r, cache=TRUE}
starwars %>%
  select(name, n_films)
```

Now we can create a factor variable that groups characters by asking whether they appeared only in
1 movie, or more:

```{r, cache=TRUE}
starwars = starwars %>%
  mutate(more_1 = case_when(n_films == 1 ~ "Exactly one movie",
                            n_films != 1 ~ "More than 1 movie"))
```

`case_when()` is a `dplyr` function that works similarly to the standard `if..else..` construct of
many programming languages (R also has this, we are going to learn about it in later chapters).

You can also create list columns with your own datasets, by using `tidyr::nest()`. Remember the
fake `survey_data` I created to illustrate `spread()` and `gather()`? Let's go back to that dataset
again:

```{r, cache=TRUE}
print(survey_data)

nested_data = survey_data %>%
  nest(variable, value)

print(nested_data)
```

This creates a new tibble, with columns `id` and `data`. `data` is a list-column that contains
tibbles; each tibble is the `variable` and `value` for each individual:

```{r, cache=TRUE}
nested_data %>%
  filter(id == "1") %>%
  pull(data)
```

As you can see, for individual 1, the column data contains a 2x2 tibble with columns `variable` and
`value`. You might be wondering why this is useful, because this seems to introduce an unnecessary
layer of complexity. The usefulness of list-columns will become apparent in the next chapters,
where we are going to learn how to repeat actions over, say, individuals.


## Exercises

### Exercise 1 {-}

Load the `LaborSupply` dataset from the `Ecdat` package and answer the following questions:

* Compute the average annual hours worked by year (plus standard deviation)
* What age group worked the most hours in the year 1982?
* Create a variable, `n_years` that equals the number of years an  individual stays in the panel. Is the panel balanced?
* Which are the individuals that do not have any kids during the whole period? Create a variable, `no_kids`, that flags these individuals (1 = no kids, 0 = kids)
* Using the `no_kids` variable from before compute the average wage, standard deviation and number of observations in each group for the year 1980 (no kids group vs kids group).
* Create the lagged logarithm of hours worked and wages. Remember that this is a panel.

```{r, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
library(Ecdat)
library(dplyr)

data("LaborSupply")

# Compute the average annual hours worked by year (plus standard deviation)

LaborSupply %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(mean(lnhr), sd(lnhr))

# What age group worked the most hours in the year 1982?

LaborSupply %>%
  filter(year == 1982) %>%
  group_by(age) %>%
  mutate(total_lnhr_age = sum(lnhr)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  filter(total_lnhr_age == max(total_lnhr_age))

# Create a variable, `n_years` that equals the number of years an
# individual stays in the panel. Is the panel balanced?

LaborSupply %>%
  group_by(id) %>%
  mutate(n_years = n()) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  summarise(mean(10))

# Which are the individuals that do not have any kids during the whole period?
# Create a variable, `no_kids`, that flags these individuals (1 = no kids, 0 = kids)

LaborSupply = LaborSupply %>%
  group_by(id) %>%
  mutate(n_kids = max(kids)) %>%
  mutate(no_kids = ifelse(n_kids == 0, 1, 0))

# Using the `no_kids` variable from before compute the average wage in 1980 for these two groups (no kids group vs kids group).
LaborSupply %>%
  filter(year == 1980) %>%
  group_by(no_kids) %>%
  summarise(mean(lnwg), sd(lnwg), n())

```

### Exercise 2 {-}

* What does the following code do? Copy and paste it in an R interpreter to find out!

```{r, eval=FALSE}
LaborSupply %>%
  group_by(id) %>%
  mutate_at(vars(starts_with("l")), funs(lag, lead))
```

`mutate_at()` is a scoped version of `mutate()` which allows you to specify a number of columns and
functions in one go. This also exists for `summarise()`.

* Using `summarise_at()`, compute the mean, standard deviation and number of individuals of `lnhr` and `lnwg` for each individual.

```{r, eval=FALSE, include = FALSE}
LaborSupply %>%
  group_by(id) %>%
  summarise_at(vars(starts_with("l"), funs(mean, sd)))
```

### Exercise 3 {-}

* In the dataset folder you downloaded at the beginning of the chapter, there is a folder called
"unemployment". I used the data in the section about working with lists of datasets. Using
`rio::import_list()`, read the 4 datasets into R.

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
paths = Sys.glob("datasets/unemployment/*.csv")

all_datasets = import_list(paths)
```

* Using `map()`, map the `janitor::clean_names()` function to each dataset (just like in the example
in the section on working with lists of datasets). Then, still with `map()` and `mutate()` convert
all commune names in the `commune` column with the function `tolower()`, in a new column called `lcommune`.
This is not an easy exercise; so here are some hints:

    * Remember that `all_datasets` is a list of datasets. Which function do you use when you want to map a function to each element of a list?
    * Each element of `all_datasets` are `data.frame` objects. Which function do you use to add a column to a `data.frame`?
    * What symbol can you use to access a column of a `data.frame`?

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
all_datasets %>%
  map(~mutate(., lcommune = tolower(.$commune)))
```
